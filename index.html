         <p>   My name is Anthony Colindres. I am 24 years old, my birthday is January 12th 1995. Go capricorns! 
         I have many interest, my primary ones being outdoors or indoors. I used to live in Colorado where I would spend most of my free time hiking through the mountains with my dogs, Phoebe and Lewis. 
         </p>
         <p>  My background is Latino and my parents come from Central America, Guatemala to be exact! I am very proud of my heritage and where I come from. When I graduated highscool I wanted to move to Guatemala but unfortunately that process turned out to be more difficult than expected.

         <p>  Six months ago i knew next to nothing about this world. I took this challenge to learn about programming and web development and now i stand here an accomplished learner. Capable of building a website for a small buisness or a full blown web application. I've begun learning, Love2D and Lua, to further my skills and knowledge to eventually break into video game development. This site is my first hosted page ever, please follow the above link to my Portfolio2.0. There you will find past projects I've completed, as well a direct way to contact me. Thank you!
